------------Computes and prunes contour tree----------------

- Carr's split and merge algorithm is used
(H. Carr, J. Snoeyink, and U. Axen. Computing contour
trees in all dimensions. In Proceedings of the
eleventh annual symposium on Discrete algorithms, pages
918â€“926, San Francisco, California, United States,
2000. Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematic.)

- A union-find like data structure is used to store and manipulate
join, split and contour trees

- Pruning is done based on similar method explained in my
doctoral thesis (Dogu Baran Aydogan. Contour Tree Connectivity
and Analysis of Microstructures. Tampere University of
Technology. 2014)

- Pruning simply removes edges whose area is below an area
threshold or if the intensity gap between the vertices of the
edges are below an intensity threshold.

- After join and split trees are merged, an intermediate tree
named the "merge tree (MT)" is computed. This is actually the
non-pruned contour tree. However since it is not pruned it is not
very useful. The prune function operates on MT and
generates the "contour tree (CT)" which is the main output.

- Since prune function does not alter merge tree, it can be called
with different area and intensity thresholds to compute a useful
contour tree.

EXAMPLE USE:

double* img;
// Fill contents of img

vector<unsigned int> size;
// Fill with dimensions of the image so that
// size[0] = number of rows
// size[1] = number of columns
// size[2] = number of slices (optional)

// The constructor creates the merge tree immediately
ContourTree ct(img,size);

// Prune the merge tree with area threshold 16 and intensity
// threshold 0.1
ct.prune(16, 0.1);

// If desired pruned the merge tree with other parameters
ct.prune(32, 0.4);
