This is a simple example for SimpleCT.

You need to have cmake to be able to use
the install script.


INSTALLATION:

Just run the "install" script as

$./install

This will create the executable
"simpleExample"


USAGE:

$./simpleExample test_128x128.uint8 0.1 32 ct ct_img.raw


Description of arguments:

- First argument (test_128x128.uint8) is the name 
of the input image file.

The format of the file name is important.

For "test_128x128.uint8", "_128x128" indicates the size.
".uint8" indicates the data format. 

The code supports 2D/3D images of types uint8 and uint16.
Example: example3D_128x128x128.uint16


- Second argument (0.1) is the intensity threshold
used in pruning

- Third argument (32) is the area/volume threshold
used in pruning

- Forth argument (ct) is the name of the file in which
the output contour tree is written (the format description
is included SimpleCT.h and SimpleCT.cpp).

- Fifth argument (ct_img.raw) is the name of the file in which
the output contour tree image is written (the format description
is included SimpleCT.h and SimpleCT.cpp).
