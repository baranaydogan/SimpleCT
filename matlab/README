SimpleCT comes with a simple MATLAB interface

In order to run the code, you need a C++
compiler (only GCC 4.6.3 is tested so far) and
compile the source for your environment.

If you have not done yet should should first run:

>> mex -setup

to setup your compiler for MATLAB.

After this step just run:

>> matlab_setup

If everything goes OK, this will compile SimpleCT
for you and run the example script in "example.m".
(The code is only tested in Ubuntu 12.04.)

The executable comes with SimpleCT for MATLAB
interface is ContourTree. This can be called as:

% Computes and prunes the contour tree
>> [ct ct_img] = ContourTree(img,0.1,32);

% Plots the contour tree
>> ContourTreePlot(img, ct, ct_img);
